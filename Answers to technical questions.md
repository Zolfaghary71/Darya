# Technical Assessment Feedback

## 1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment?
I was given one and a half days, of which I spent about 5 hours on the project. 

I wish I had more time to do way better, both in terms of clean code and architecture. I would also spend more time breaking down and cleaning bloated code in some parts of the project. I would use fixtures, replace the current implementation with Redis, and encrypt credentials to enhance security.

The reason I chose an in-memory database and this kind of cache is that it could be run with a single click with no configuration.

## 2. What would you add to your solution if you had more time? 
If you didnâ€™t spend much time on the coding assignment, use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

I would add event sourcing and publish events to implement an event-driven architecture. I would create another project to act as a gateway.

## 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
I would identify which part of the system is causing the issue. I would check the resources for each service and locate bottlenecks. 

Steps I would follow:
- Analyze logs.
- Perform benchmarking.
- Conduct stress testing.

These steps would help identify the problematic areas.

## 4. What was the latest technical book you have read or tech conference you have been to?
I attended a DDD event last month hosted by Alibaba. 

I am also reading Vaughn Vernon's book on Domain-Driven Design and studying his ideas on event sourcing.

## 5. What do you think about this technical assessment?
It was a good assessment, but I wish I had more time.
