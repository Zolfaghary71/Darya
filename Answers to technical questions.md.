1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment?
i was given one an half day of which i spend about 5 hours on the project. 
i wish i had more time to do way better both in terms of clean code and architecture.
i would also spend more time breaking down and cleaning bloated code on some part of the project.
i would use fixtures. i would use redis instead of this.
the reason i chose in memory db and this kind of cache is that it could be run with single click with no configuration.

2. What would you add to your solution if you had more time?If you didnt spend
much time on the coding assignment then use this as an opportunity to explain
what you would add.
i would add event sourcing and publish events and do event driven architecture. i would creat another project to act as gate way.

3. 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
i would have to find which part of the system is causing it. i would check the resources for each serivce and find bottlenecks.
i would check logs and perform benchmarking and stress testing to find which parts are causing it.

4. What was the latest technical bookyou have read or tech conference you have been to?
i was in an DDD event last month which ran in ali baba.
i was reading vaugh vernons book on DDD and i was reading on event sourcing and his idea of it.

5. Whatdo you think about this technical assessment?
it was good assesment but i wish i had more time.
